# Automatic-Email-sender
1.Objective: The goal is to automate the process of sending emails through Gmail's SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server using a Python script.

2.Script and Libraries: 
The script is written in Python.
The  library smtplib is utilized. This library is part of Python's standard library and provides functions for sending emails using the SMTP protocol.

3.Security Considerations:Emphasis is placed on ensuring a secure connection. This likely involves using secure protocols such as SSL or TLS when connecting to Gmail's SMTP server. This is crucial for protecting sensitive information, such as login credentials.

4.Console Output: The success of the email-sending process is confirmed through console output. This is likely achieved by printing relevant messages or status updates to the console during the script execution.
This Python script automates email sending via Gmail's SMTP server using the smtplib library, ensuring a secure  connection. The success of the process is confrmed through console output. I used this to automatically send birthday emails(Used PythonAnywhere to enable daily cloud-based execution).

A Potential use case:
